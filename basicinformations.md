# Gather basic informations about the "Enchantment" module.

Informations about how it works can be found in [FAQ](https://en.footballteamgame.com/faq/1/39)

Based on those informations I've created a component description: 
>The Enhancement function allows users to strengthen the skill bonuses of items they possess in the game. The strength of the bonus depends on the rarity of the item, and there is a risk of failure during the enhancement process. Using Golden Balls can prevent the loss of bonuses in case of failure.
